class_name NoiseEvents
extends RefCounted
## Loud things that happened (gunshots for now). Static, like WorldState, so any
## system can report a noise and any listener can read it without wiring signals
## across scenes. Pure and deterministic: every event gets a serial id, and a
## listener keeps the last id it read, so nothing is heard twice and nothing
## depends on wall-clock time.
##
## Writers: player_weapons.gd (each blaster shot). Readers: Perception (guards).
