## What is true in the world right now (M12): faction standing, town flags,
## counters, the job board, credits and a short log of recent events.
##
## Static, like GameFlow, so it survives scene changes (town -> flight -> town)
## without an autoload. Systems write to it when something actually happens
## (a fight won, shots fired in the street, a job accepted); the cantina owner only
## ever reads it. That is what keeps her rumors true: a rumor is shown to her
## only when its conditions hold here (see rumors()).
##
## Saved and restored through SaveSystem (to_save / from_save).
