## Skrugs's speeder post (issue #42). Issue #295: a different place per town
## layout: in the round port his yard inside the wall right behind the cantina, in
## the square port out in the sand past the back gate. Its footprint is world data
## (the "skrugs_post" landmark in content/core/worlds/port_desert.json, resolved per
## layout, and its location: content/core/locations/skrugs_post*.json), so the ship
## and speeders already collide with it and the player walks on it. This node adds:
##   - the look: a small house in the town's style, the stall, the display pad, his
##     garage (wall pieces you drive into) and its bench, and the sand ramp out past
##     the back gate (the "skrugs_ramp" landmark, with its sloped collider: a box
##     would be a wall),
##   - Skrugs: an all-red local behind the counter, a TalkSpot on the town's
##     ConversationHost, run by the same NpcBrain as the Cantina Owner from his
##     own card (content/core/npcs/skrugs_card.json),
##   - the display speeder on its pad (not rideable),
##   - buying: Skrugs proposes (offer_speeder), the chat box shows the price, and
##     only the player's click pays. 100 credits off, a speeder parked in his
##     garage (then beside it), his mood warm. Speeders you own are saved
##     (WorldState counter "speeders_owned") and parked there again next time.
##   - issue #295, free roam only: [E] at his garage bench is Dorrin's parts menu
##     (SpeederShop) for the speeder in his garage,
##   - issue #295: he buys ships. One of yours landed within ship_buy's radius
##     (100 m) of his stall (a stolen outpost ship, for stolen_rate times its list
##     price, or the one T-89 sold you, at T-89's buy-back price): his chat offers
##     it (offer_ship_buy), and only the player's click sells. A stolen one he
##     offers for the moment you talk to him (the spot's opener).
##   - issue #368: turn down his price for a stolen ship and he offers to clean it
##     up instead, for keep_rate times its list price: only your click pays, and
##     it is yours (Fleet: no longer hunted, T-89 upgrades it, it stays where you
##     leave it). He buys your kept ships back at T-89's buy-back price.
