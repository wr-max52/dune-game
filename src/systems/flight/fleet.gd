## The ships you own (issue #368). Pure and static, like ShipUpgrades; what is
## true lives in WorldState (saved):
##   - "wreck": the wreck T-89 rebuilt (WorldState.SHIP_REBUILT + wreck_ship),
##   - "t89":   the ship he sold you (WorldState.hangar),
##   - "kept_N": a stolen ship Skrugs cleaned up for you (WorldState.kept_ships).
## Each is known by that key. One is the primary (WorldState.primary_ship): it waits
## on the pit pad wherever you wake (ShipPilot.woke_in_pit) and it is the one Call
## brings to you (ShipPilot.call_ship). The others stay where you last left them,
## planet and spot (WorldState.ship_spots), across saves.
##
## A primary shot to pieces is not lost: it is back on the pad the next time you
## wake (or load), and T-89's repair fee comes out of your credits (repair()).
