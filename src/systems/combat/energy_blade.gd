## Energy blade (M3). Pure, headless-testable melee state machine with a stamina
## budget. The core skill is DEFLECTION: pressing block and holding it through an
## incoming bolt within a tight timing window deflects the bolt instead of taking
## its damage. Stamina gates light/heavy attacks and sustained blocking.
##
## This is the melee combat layer of M3. The duelist enemy that also blocks,
## parries, and pressures is a separate brain; it consumes the same blade logic so
## it can deflect the player's bolts too.
