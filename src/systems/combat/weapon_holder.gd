class_name WeaponHolder
extends RefCounted
## Which hand weapon the player has out, and the swap between them (M11). Pure.
##
## A swap is HOLSTER (put the current one away) then DRAW (bring the next one
## up). Pressing again mid-swap retargets cleanly: during HOLSTER it just changes
## where we are going; during DRAW it reverses into a HOLSTER from the same point,
## so spamming the keys never desyncs the hands from the weapon.
##
## `drawn()` (0..1) is how far the current weapon is from its holster; the avatar
## blends holster -> ready with it. `update()` returns events for sound and the
## blade's ignite/retract: "holstered:<id>", "drawing:<id>", "drawn:<id>".
