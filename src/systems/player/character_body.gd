## Player character node (M1).
##
## Two ways to drive it:
##   - Human: a real key/gamepad. When no command was pushed this frame, the node
##     reads input actions and steps the controller from them.
##   - Bot / demo: call set_command(...) to push a movement command for this frame.
##     That makes the command authoritative -- the input reader is skipped so the
##     bot is never clobbered by "no input". M5's bot uses exactly this path, so
##     human and bot share one movement implementation.
