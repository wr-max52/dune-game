## The Remnant general in a story save (issues #203, #204, #205, #213, #214).
##   - Where he stands: in the pit beside your wreck while the story is at the
##     "general" chapter (he meets you as you step out), then in the barracks yard
##     with one guard and an assassin droid. Gone while he is a bounty out at an
##     outpost, and for good once he is dead.
##   - An AI character on the town's ConversationHost, from his own card
##     (content/core/npcs/general_card.json). [E] beside him opens a menu, like
##     T-89's: talk, ask for work, hand over a droid.
##   - He, his guard and his droid face the front gate ("face": a town marker), in
##     a row abreast: their offsets are in the squad's own frame. In the pit the
##     row stands off your ship's tail, so you climb out boxed in against it.
##   - In the barracks yard (while the Remnant hold the moon) they are real: he and
##     his guard are garrison troopers (NpcBody, "squad" soldier profiles) and the
##     droid one of the Remnant's droids, so they can be shot, and they fight where
##     they stand when the town alarm goes up. Killed there he is gone for good
##     (WorldState.on_general_killed): Oda's bounty goes on someone else.
##   - The pit meeting opens the moment you climb out of your ship, and is his to
##     end: you cannot walk away (Esc) until he lets you go (let_go) or has you
##     searched (search). That verdict sets the Remnant standing you start with. If
##     his brain never gives one (or no model answers), the game has you searched
##     after four of his lines (the meeting's "default"). Either way he closes with
##     a hint at work for an outlander (the Work for the general quest), then he and
##     his escort walk out of the pit to the barracks ("leave"): no cut, so you
##     stand where you stood at the same time of day.
##   - Insults cost Remnant standing; too many in one talk and his guards search you
##     on the spot (the gate's rules: WorldState.search_player). In the pit meeting
##     that search is his verdict.
##   - His job (j_general_droids, issue #204): assassin droids from the desert, for
##     pay_mult times the droid merchant's resale, each raising Remnant standing.
##     Not while you are hostile. In good standing he tells you about the crashed
##     cruiser (issue #205: the quest's event, heard_of_wreck).
##   - His second job (j_general_repossess, issue #251): contraband smugglers
##     stashed inside the town, offered in talk. [E] hands him what you found,
##     for more than the fence would have paid, and raises Remnant standing.
##   - Once the Remnant has left the moon (issue #214) he stays, in the desert armour.
##
## Config: content/core/npcs/general.json. The headless test calls talk_ended(),
## on_insult(), decide(), take_job(), hand_over() and hand_over_contraband() directly.
