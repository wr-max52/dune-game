class_name TalkSpot
extends RefCounted
## One AI character you can walk up to and talk to (issue #42): their brain, their
## body, and the spot the player stands on. The ConversationHost owns the parts
## every character shares (the model service, the chat box, the save) and runs
## whichever spot the player is at.
##
## The body is any Node3D. If it has `act_named(name, seconds)` ("idle",
## "thinking", "talking", "pouring") and `speak_pulse()`, the host drives them; a
## plain character just stands there.
