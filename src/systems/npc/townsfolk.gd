## The port's own people: the director for every NpcBody whose soldier profile is
## in the "locals" faction, the way Garrison runs the Remnant troopers. Same pieces
## (GuardBrain per body, a TownAlarm for the lot), different rules:
##
##   calm      residents and shoppers walk their loops (marker "patrol" routes);
##             merchants and the fence mind their stall and look around
##   alarm     raised when the player hurts or kills any local. Every local in town
##             fights: walkers take cover and close in on their leash, merchants
##             (profile combat.hold_ground) duck behind the counter and shoot over
##             it, never leaving the stall. Everyone's pistol (profile "sidearm")
##             comes out when the alarm goes up and is put away after
##   after     calm again when the player flees or is downed. After fleeing the
##             locals remember the face for memory_s and start again on sight;
##             once the player wakes in the pit they forget it (forgive_player)
##
## Their own alarm, not the garrison's: shooting a local does not call the Remnant,
## and a gate fight does not turn the market on you. While the locals are up in
## arms (or the stall keeper is dead) a vendor will not trade (vendor_open).
##
## Who does what comes from the profile's "role": "local" (walks a loop),
## "merchant" (holds a stall). Numbers: content/core/soldiers/local_*.json and
## the town's "locals" block; barks: content/core/dialogue/locals_lines.json.
##
## They know the planet's beast (PlanetBeast): calm, a local you walk close by now
## and then says something about it, by name (its "lore" in the planet's file).
