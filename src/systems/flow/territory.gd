extends RefCounted
## Who holds each place (issue #187): the Remnant or the locals. Pure and static,
## like Story; its state lives in WorldState.control (saved with the world):
##   { <outpost id>: { owner: "locals", hold: seconds left }, supply: <outpost id> }
## An outpost with no entry is the Remnant's (for ever, until you clear it).
## Issue #425: once the cruiser has fallen (Story.cruiser_taken) the Remnant on
## the ground are cut off, and every outpost of theirs gets an entry too:
## { owner: "remnant", hold: seconds left }, staggered so they run short one at a
## time. When one runs out the locals move in on their own (give_up). A player
## the Remnant still deal with (remnant_friend) is offered a resupply quest for
## each one that runs short (resupply_remnant_<id>); walking up to it with that
## quest's waypoint on fills its clock back up (deliver_remnant).
##
##   an outpost    the Remnant's until every trooper there is dead (take), then the
##                 locals' for hold_s of play. A supply run from Oda (j_supply)
##                 fills that up again (taken once, you are their supplier: the
##                 map shows who is short and any of them takes supplies, with
##                 no job to take again); when it runs out, or the locals' guards
##                 there are all dead, the Remnant take it back (retake).
##   the barracks  the Remnant's until the story is done (the fleet beaten) or the
##                 Remnant are driven off (every outpost held at once); then
##                 the locals'. Story.town_garrison() reads it. Issue #303: when
##                 every local guard on its posts is dead, the Remnant take it
##                 back (town_retaken), hostile or (on the dark master's oath) not.
##                 Driving them off every outpost again gives it back to the locals.
##                 Once the fleet is beaten, a dead Remnant trooper at the
##                 barracks stays dead (control.remnant_dead); the last one hands
##                 the town to the locals (free_town). Driven off, the Remnant come
##                 back only this way: kill every local guard at the barracks.
##                 The town scene swaps the people over once you are out of sight.
##
## What it changes: who stands at each place (RemnantOutposts, the town scene and
## DroidController ask owner()), the gate checkpoint (gate_strict, bribe_mult),
## the fence's prices (fence_mult), Oda's supply job and a resupply quest per
## outpost (quests), rumors (the flags below), the objective pointer, the F1
## screen (summary) and the F11 map (GlobeMap).
##
## Other fronts (territory.json "fronts": the moon, the lava moon), each with its own outposts, its own
## barracks under a dome and its own drive-off flag, on the same rules as the
## port's: kill every trooper at a moon outpost and the locals move in (no hold
## clock there and no supply runs: they keep it until their guards there are all
## dead); hold all of them at once and the Remnant are driven off the moon, and the
## locals take its barracks. The moon's barracks also go to the locals when the
## fleet is beaten, the Remnant take them back when the locals' guards there are
## all dead, and once the fleet is beaten killing every trooper there frees them.
## Once the cruiser has fallen the moon's Remnant outposts run short and give up
## one at a time too (no resupply quests there). Every function that takes a
## `front` ("home" or a "fronts" key such as "moon") defaults to the port's; one that takes a place id
## works out its front from the id (front_of).
