class_name Story
extends RefCounted
## The main story line (issue #64). Pure and static, like WorldState, and its
## state lives there (WorldState.story, saved with the world):
##
##   T-89 says talk to Oda -> she sends you to practice at the range -> she pays
##   for it and tells you about the sparring droid (optional: go to the pit and
##   come back, on your honour) -> two smuggling runs
##   (the first with her old jetpack if she is amused or warm) -> Skrugs and a
##   bounty at a Remnant outpost -> the Remnant fleet in orbit (the port's ships
##   unlock): one mission, the general on the bridge of their star cruiser far out
##   east (issue #193; the fleet's fighters meet you on the way up, and beating
##   them is not the mission) -> back to Oda (issue #303: the debrief; the kill is
##   paid and saved on the spot) -> the end card -> free play: smuggling runs and
##   bounty contracts on repeat.
##
## Issue #303: after the general dies a dark master waits in the cruiser's bay
## (DarkMasterPost). Join him and the debrief can end the other way: clear the
## barracks' local guards and the Remnant hold the moon (DarkPact).
##
## Chapters and every line: content/core/story/main.json. Systems report what
## happened with event() (WorldState does most of it); a teller asks beat() when
## the player talks to them and says the line it gets back.
##
## The Remnant follow the story too: before the fleet is beaten the town's
## garrison respawns behind the barracks; after, the town is free of them (issue
## #187: the locals hold the barracks), and the desert outposts are always hostile
## (issue #303: unless you swore the dark master's oath; and the Remnant take the
## town back if its barracks guards all die).
## Who holds the outposts in between: Territory.
