## Cinematic view (V's third view). Pure, like the camera rig and the chase
## camera: a camera that cuts to a new spot near its subject every `shot_time`
## seconds and, between cuts, hangs there, turning to keep the subject framed and
## drifting after it on a slack lead, so the subject walks (or flies) out ahead of
## it. On foot the rig node owns one, in ships and speeders the chase camera does;
## `scale` sizes the shots to the subject. The owner hands it a ray check
## (`blocked`) so a shot never sits behind a wall, and a shot that loses sight of
## the subject cuts early.

## Each shot: [bearing off the subject's forward (deg), distance, height], the
## last two in units of `scale`. Front quarters, sides, a low trailing shot, a high
## wide one. A cut never picks the shot already on screen.
